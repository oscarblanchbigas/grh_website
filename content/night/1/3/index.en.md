{{< header_night title="A graph is worth a thousand words">}}

Imagine spending the whole night awake on top of a mountain, on an island, with your friends. Imagine seeing the sunrise surrounded by the sea, with clouds of a thousand different shades of red. When the sun rises, you go to sleep and wait for it to go on again. Almost like a vampire.

Well, this is not exactly what we do. Observing is an intense job. The telescopes have to be ready, we must make sure that everything is in order not to lose an hour of observation. The nights are long and you have to be patient, keep on the lookout for our precious gammas.

And you must know something else.

Hunting gammas does not mean seeing pictures of spectacular colors like the one on the right. We, when we hunt gamma rays, what we see is this:

Sure you like the colors of the images that get telescopes like Hubble. Me too. But do not be disappointed because MAGIC does not have those colors and shapes. We hunt gammas, and that is one of the prices that you have to pay to get closer to the most violent Universe. You will see how in a short time the fact that the photos are not so catchy will seem a low price to enter the world of high cosmic energies.

Getting such a graph requires hours of observation. More than you imagine. Because when you turn on the telescope and point to a source, the first thing you see is nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Then time passes and what you see is noise. Nothing but noise.

How do we get to see the gamma rays that reach us? Keep watching me and you'll see.
