To use our telescopes, you do not need to look through a small hole with one eye while closing the other. Gamma-ray telescopes do not work that way. With your eyes you would not be able to catch even a gamma ray.

You need an ultra-fast camera that detects flashes of light of a few nanoseconds. This is the MAGIC camera: it takes very fast photos and then we analyze them on the computer.

    text="Do not think that hunters spend the day in front of a screen looking at pictures. These telescopes are there working because the researchers themselves build them, fix them and operate them. To be a hunter you have to know how to do a lot of things." >}}

When I am not observing with the telescopes I spend time in the workshop surrounded by electronics trying to improve the MAGIC camera. Now we are working on new filters that allow us to observe with full Moon.

The Cherenkov Telescopes like MAGIC observe only at night. Even the light of the Moon bothers them to see the gamma rays that come from other stars, or what is left of them: Supernova Remnants.

That is why we have been developing filters that allow observing with the Moon. The filters do not allow the moonlight to reach the photosensors, but they light generated by the gamma rays can still arrive to them.
