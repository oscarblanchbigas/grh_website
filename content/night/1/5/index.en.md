{{< header_night title="Hunters with patience" >}}

Three hours pointing to CasA and what do you see? Nothing really important. Have you done something wrong? Is the code playing tricks on you? Do the filters not behave as they should? Has the telescope been broken? Have not you pointed to the coordinates you should?

No. It's just like that. Gamma rays are scarce. It takes patience to hunt them. Poiting the telescope for 3 hours only guarantees one thing: few gamma rays will be catched.

Cosmic rays there are many. But gamma rays there are not so many. For every 30,000 cosmic, we can only expect 1 gamma ray.

So do not despair. You just need more time. How much? It depends.

To see CasA I went up night after night until I had 100 hours of observation. See how the amount of gamma rays changes when the hours increase. Vary the number of observation hours and see how the Theta Square graphic changes.

Clearly there is a signal. CasA emits gamma rays. But do not trust these images. Do the calculation yourself with the data you will find on the page on the right.

Now that we know, thanks to the graphs, that CasA emits gamma rays, we can find a way to represent what CasA would look like if we had gamma-ray glasses. It's the closest thing to a photo that MAGIC telescopes can do, but we call it SkyMap, a gamma-ray sky map.
