{{< header_night title="What do we do with the Gamma Rays?" >}}

We arrived at the end of the first night, or rather, at the end of the many nights of observation that allowed us to detect the gamma rays from CasA.

Along the way we have found the telescopes and the programming code, two essential tools for hunters.

Without computers and programming things would be more difficult, and slower. Today the MAGIC data is sent to a calculation center (the Port d'Informació Científica in Barcelona) to be processed. And we connect to the data center to analyze the observations. Do this with photos, pencil and paper ... I can not imagine what it would mean.

And without the telescopes ... well, without the telescopes there is nothing. There would be no gamma detection and we would be dedicating ourselves to something else.

Now that we have detected gamma rays from CasA gamma, you may wonder what we can do with them. If you continue with us you will see what we can learn from supernovas, quasars and even the speed of light itself studying gamma rays.

There are cosmic accelerators out there where the particles travel at enormous speeds and emit a very energetic light. There are stars outside that explode, releasing a lot of energy and also black holes that swallow stars.

Gamma rays help us to study all these phenomena.

But to achieve it you have to know how to hunt them. And that not only requires patience but also skill, with telescopes, code and, of course, with physics.

Join the other hunters in their research nights and discover how experimental physics is much more than inclined planes, pulleys and problems that are solved using the right formula.
