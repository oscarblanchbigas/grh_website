    text="This is Leyre. One of the things he likes the most is driving. It does not have problems in taking the car and to do kilometers and kilometers seeing the landscape happen. Who is really moving, she or the landscape? Questions like this gave rise to the theory of relativity, a new way of thinking about space and time. Leyre uses the MAGIC telescopes to precisely test this theory." >}}

Here we are all Gamma Ray Hunters, but some of us are more selective than others.

Of all the gamma rays, the ones that interest me are those that come from **flares**.

What are flares? We use the flare concept to refer to a period in which we get more gamma rays than usual from a particular position in the Universe.

{{< quote
    text="Our way of understanding a flare is not so different from its real meaning: it could be compared to lighting a match that is quickly consumed. Although, of course, it is a flame that is millions of light years away and with a much higher energy." >}}

For example, in June 2015 a flare was detected from blazar 3C279, five billion light years. The last time activity was detected in it was in 1991! After 14 years appears without warning ... And, so far, it is the most luminous high energy object that has been observed.

{{< video url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Rl4l6tuHGg" caption="In this video each circle represents a gamma ray detected by FERMI. The size and color of the circles give an idea of its magnitude. Notice how at a certain moment, the amount of gamma rays increases: that is the flare.">}}


Normally 3C279 is one of the many active galaxies that we can observe.

But from one day to the next it became the brightest object in the sky Gamma. And so for 4 days. That was precisely the flare.

{{< img name="flare.png" caption="The flare started on June 14, 2015 and 4 days later it was over. We still do not know why it happened.">}}

Each day of observation we make a plan of the objects that we want to observe. For today we have remnants of supernovas, binary systems, pulsars, clusters of galaxies, ...

The flares, which are the ones that interest me, are never on the menu of the day. But of course, you never know when they will happen.
