I've been up here for 4 weeks now, it's time to go home.

From there I can also continue hunting gamma rays. I just need a computer and the new shift crew to operate the telescopes from here.

Maybe some gamma rays skip the limit of the speed of light, we still do not know. Other flares will arrive and we will continue taking data. But before continuing to hunt I plan to take a few days, get into the car and drive no matter where. The highway helps me imagine those gamma rays that skip the speed limit. When somebody overtakes me or when a truck finds it hard to keep up on a climb I think 'Look, there goes one'.

I wish to discover them so much! If they exist, of course, otherwise the road will have been worthwhile. There is nothing better than seeing the landscape go by. That means we move!

And you, are you ready for your night?

If you have any questions, you can always check our nights again or ask in the forum. Any question you have, we will solve it. It's what we always do among hunters.

Go ahead and experiment with your night and enter the draw.

It may seem difficult, but it is not!
