{{< header_night title="To observe or to not observe, that is the question">}}

You already know that when we observe we are not looking through an eyepiece as in amateur telescopes. We have screens that give us all kinds of information about the data and what we observe.

But an eye must always be attentive to the mail. Important notices can arrive at any time.

{{< img name="mail.png" caption="The mail is the tool of work that we most need. We also use social networks and messages but, in our case, what is really important you always find out by mail.">}}

**Yes!! Let's go for it!**

We are lucky, they warn us in English. But it can not be otherwise. The two other large facilities of Cherenkov telescopes are in Namibia (HESS) and in the United States (VERITAS).

It seems that Mkn 421 is in "flare" so we should try to observe it. But on the other hand we are supposed to follow the Agenda. What should I do?

{{< quote
    text="To take data with the MAGIC telescopes you need at least three people in the observatory. Among them, one is the last responsible. And today it's my turn to make the decisions." >}}

But if I stop looking at Cas A, Daniel will get angry. If I miss Perseus' observations, Quim will not talk to me anymore. If today is the day that Cyg-X1 has decided to emit gamma rays, Alba will get heart attack. But a "flare" like that only happens very occasionally ...

It is not easy to decide. From my point of view it is clear what it is the best option: go for the flare. But in a collaboration like MAGIC, with more than 100 people, there are many different points of view. And there is not only one that is correct.

At 3 o'clock in the morning there is no one to call and ask. I'll decide myself: Let's go for MKn 421 !!
