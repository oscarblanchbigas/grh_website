Do you dare to try to see if Einstein was wrong?

In the notebook on the right you will learn how I do the calculations to see if all the gamma rays reach us at the same speed.

Now do the calculations and graphs without fear. It's your last chance before your big night.

It seems clear that there is a different arrival time for different energies.

But prudence must continue to be imposed. To be sure that the effect comes from different speeds of the photons we should see a delay consistent with the same speed from several sources located at different distances from Earth. With a single particular case we can not discard a theory, we need much more evidences.

The only thing we can do is keep watching the flares and catch all the gamma rays we can with our telescopes.
