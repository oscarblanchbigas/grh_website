{{< header_night title="Active galactic nuclei">}}

Mkn 421 is a galaxy withi an active nucleus located in Ursa Major. In fact, it is one of the closest to Earth, only 400 million light years away.

It was one of the first sources from where we saw that gamma rays arrived and it is one of the sources that we know whose gamma rays reach the Earth in a more usual way.

But in addition, on rare occasions, it emits much more, becoming the brightest object in the gamma-ray universe. And not just a little more, but a full order of magnitude (10 times brighter).

In the notebook on the right you can see how we analyzed first if there is a signal in the data we have taken tonight on Mkn 421 and then how we look at the temporal evolution of the signal during the night.

**Is there or is there no flare?**
