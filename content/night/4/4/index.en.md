Surely the best-known Physicist of all time is Albert Einstein. You will all have heard about him.

And one of the most famous scientific theories, his theory of relativity. For sure it tells you something too.

The theory of relativity does not say that everything is relative. In fact, one of its basic hypotheses is that there is something that is never relative, something that is totally absolute.

What is that something? **The speed of light in a vacuum**, which the theory of relativity considers constant.

{{< img name="speed_of_light.png" caption="In the vacuum, the speed of light takes this constant value and never exceeds it. Or at least nothing has shown the contrary until now. There are theories that propose new ideas regarding the speed of light. But they are not yet proven." >}}


What I want to show (or at least try) is that this hypothesis is not true, that the speed of light in a vacuum can be greater or less than what we know. It is what we call in the field Violation of Lorentz Invariance. And it is something that several theories propose to get to unify the Theory of Relativity with Quantum Theory in a great theory that would encompass all physics: the big and the small. It is what is known as the **Theory of Quantum Gravity**.

What if we find gamma rays that travel to a higher or lower value than the speed of light? It would be our way of showing that the hypothesis is not true: finding something that does not comply. And that is the "only" thing that scientists can do because demonstrating that something is true is basically impossible since you can not prove infinite possibilities.

In MAGIC we have been monitoring gammas since 2005 and measuring their energies and arrival times. It is an ideal instrument to search for photons faster or slower than the speed of light." >}}

We said that Mrk 421 is very close to Earth by the standards of the Universe, but it still remains at 400 million light years.

Let's suppose two photons of different energies that go (hypothetically) at different speeds. After traveling a distance as long as that between Mrk 421 and Earth, they should reach Earth at different times.

That's what I try to measure myself, that gap that can be only a few seconds.

And to do so, I observe if the temporal evolution of the flare is delayed when I look at it for different energies.

That would corroborate that really gammas of different energies travel at different speeds, right?
