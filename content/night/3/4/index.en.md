{{< header_night title="Models, hypotheses and data">}}

For many years now we have observed the grouping of Perseus galaxies. In fact we have more data from Perseus than from CasA.

Perseus has a size of 65 million light years, but since it is 250 million light years, its apparent size in the sky is few degrees and we can cover it with the camera of our telescopes.

Analyze the data we have from Perseus. Now you know how to do it. Look for the Theta2 plot of the accumulated data of Perseus in the scientific notebook and try to interpret the result.

Cosmologists show us how dark matter should be distributed in Perseus. They have studied it with optical telescopes and can make maps of dark matter from areas of the Universe.

And theoretical physicists use models to calculate the amount of gamma rays we would expect to find. With that information we are hunting.

We have hypotheses and we have some telescopes at our disposal: we will look into the data to see if they are true.

The theory I am testing predicts that the number of gamma rays we should observe follows this logic:

**Ngamma_ray ( r ) = N_0 (si r<0.1 deg)**

**Ngamma_ray ( r ) = N_0/(100* r^2) (si r>= 0.1 deg)**

In the notebook on the right, you can see how I use this and the fact that I do not see gamma rays from Perseus to define the maximum of dark matter in Perseus.
