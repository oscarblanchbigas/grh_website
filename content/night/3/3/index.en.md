I am not interested in astrophysics but in the most fundamental physics. **Astrophysics** is the description of the phenomena of what we see out there using the laws of physics. The **fundamental physics** tries to understand the physical laws that govern nature.

Looking for dark matter is one of the goals of fundamental physics because what is more fundamental than knowing the content of the Universe?

I am not so interested in knowing if in a supernova remnant (like CasA) there are interactions between protons or if the radiation that comes from them is produced by the electrons themselves. It is not wrong to ask if the microquasar emit gamma radiation or not. But, what am I going to do, what really catches my attention is knowing what our universe is made of. Do not you find it surprising that we are not clear yet?

Tonight at MAGIC we will observe the Perseus cluster.

All the calculations suggest that it has a lot of dark matter. And some theoretical models predict that dark matter colliding with itiself can produce gamma rays.

Let's go for them. We can not let them escape.
