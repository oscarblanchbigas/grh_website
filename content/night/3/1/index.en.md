    text="This is Quim. When you are not hunting Rays Gamma you will find it doing high mountain crossings. But reaching the top is not your only goal. He knows that if he is not attentive at every moment and enjoys the way, everything loses its meaning. The same happens when hunting gamma rays, and more if your goal is to discover what the Universe is made of." >}}

Sometimes the day starts at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. And no, you are not in summer, on vacation, without homework or exams in September.

It happens to the MAGIC shifters every time we come to observe. For 4 weeks we say good morning, although there is not much left for the sun to set.

This time I'm with Roberta from Italy, Dario from Croatia and Kenji from Japan, who today has to make breakfast. What will they have breakfast in Japan?

Each one of us who are making this shift have a different scientific objective, each one observes a different source, and asks different questions. But we all find in MAGIC telescopes the ideal instrument for our research. That's why we are all here and we help each other during the observation nights.

My goal is to detect, even indirectly, Dark Matter, one of the great mysteries of the Universe.
