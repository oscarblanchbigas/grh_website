{{< header_night title="Magic mirror, tell me what you see">}}

The first thing that Shifters do when their working day begins is to start up the telescopes.

And it seems that today the day starts badly. Alarm signal in the mirror system. There is a problem when it comes to aligning them. How do we know? Because we have a laser system that allows us to see exactly where each mirror points.

{{< quote
    text="MAGIC has one of the largest mirrors in the world, but it is not a single mirror but many small ones that have to be aligned so that all the light of the gamma rays that reaches them is concentrated in the camera." >}}

{{< img name="magic_lasers.png" caption="Each mirror must point in the right direction or we will lose gamma rays. The laser allows us to have everything properly aligned ... and correct when there is a problem" credit="MAGIC Collaboration">}}

It was already too many days without any problem. And with so many misaligned mirrors, it makes no sense to observe. We are sending most of the light that comes from the gamma rays out of the camera. While my colleagues try to locate the experts, I will see if in the manuals I find possible solutions.

- Turn all mirrors off and back on at the same time
- Turn off and on again the mirrors one by one
- Manually move the mirrors to the maximum
- Eat a Canarian banana
- Check if a laser is left on
- Check...

The banana trick does not work. I do not know if we are going to solve it. And the minutes pass, and ...

... wait, here is a disconnected cable ... let's see ... Yes! Fixed up. We have lost time but, we arrived to observe my Dark Matter!
