{{< header_night title="Always attentive to the landscape">}}

Sometimes you start a journey and you do not reach your destination. Because the time has changed, because there are no more forces or because the road was the wrong one. You have no choice but to go back.

However, you can always get something positive out of the work done. We can warn other mountaineers that better choose another path. Or let them know that the time has changed above.

If we also look at the landscape with each step we take, we may find things unexpected and totally different from what we were looking for.

The same happens when hunting gammas. Dark matter will have to wait. But are those hundreds of hours of observation to be thrown away? No kidding. There is a lot of analysis to be done and we can still get a surprise.

My boss always tells me not to waste time doing additional things and to concentrate on the search for dark matter.

But I like to search if something else appears in the data. Although I never find anything. If you want, you can look in the notebook how I do a skymap of the region and look beyond what I had planned to do.

Dark matter is distributed around the center of the cluster of galaxies. And that's why we're going to look for it there. But, what if we do not look in the center of the cluster?
