{{< header_night title="Separate the grain from the straw">}}

The data arrives and the first thing we do is analyze them.

The **Theta Plot** helps us see the number of gamma rays we detect in concentric rings at the point at which we are directing the telescope. But the analysis does not end there. Actually there are many other things that we should do.

Something very important is to select, as far as possible, the images generated by gamma rays and those generated by other types of cosmic rays, such as protons or light nuclei.

Actually we do not know for sure if what we detect is a gamma ray or another particle ... At each detection the software of the telescope gives it a value that represents how it looks like a gamma ray or something else (proton, muon, nucleus of a light atom ...). It is what we call **hadroness**.

{{< quote
    text="The hadroness is a number between 0 and 1. Low Hadroness means that what we have detected is likely to be a gamma ray. High Hadroness means that it is most likely a different type of cosmic ray." >}}

At the time of doing the thetaplot we must make sure that we are representing the events with small hadroness, since we are hunters of **gamma rays**, right? So we took off the protons.

{{< quote
    text="I am going to confess something: the data that we used when detecting the gamma rays of Cas A during my night already had the cut in hadroness done. I did not tell you so that you would not come all at once but we had already taken the grain out of the straw."

Now follow my notebook on the right to see how doing a cut in hadroness we get to see signal ... or not?

Have you seen Theta plot? With that and I would write the paper while I keep thinking about how lucky I am to have hunted Cyg-X1. But every time I get excited, I remember what my thesis supervisor always tells me:

This is experimental physics, Alba. We need data, a lot of data, to prove something.

_-How do you know that what you see is not noise?

_-How do you know what is really Cyg-X1 and not just your desire to have hunted? _

_-Keep calm, wait for more data to arrive and **analyze them**.
