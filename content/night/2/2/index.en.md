{{< header_night title="How many MAGIC fit in the sky?" >}}

The sky is very large and the field of view of our telescopes is very small. But what exactly does "very small" mean? Would you be able to compute how many MAGICs fit in the sky to get an idea?

{{< img name="fov.png" caption="We can only see a part of the sky with the MAGIC telescopes. How much? A good way to get an idea is to compare it with the size of the full Moon.">}}

Look in the notebook on the right to see how the fraction of the sky that MAGIC sees is calculated. Sure you know the trigonometry to use ... but when it comes to calculating things from telescopes, is funier, right ?!

We have catalogs of the exact positions of the sources of gamma rays detected by satellites such as Fermi, and there we aim to analyze them in detail.

The coordinates of Cygnus-X1 I know them from memory (RA = 19: 58: 21, DEC = 35: 12: 5) is right in the middle of the tail of the Swan. Not that it is "my" microquasar, but I have been so long after it, waiting for the moment when it gives us a signal, that it sends us gamma rays that we can hunt ... that is almost my obsession.

It does not make sense to point the MAGIC telescopes all the time to Cygnus-X1. I must wait for the black hole to swallow so much matter that it starts to "shoot" high-energy gamma rays. The rest of the hunters want to see other sources, and you know, we all help each other.

##### But please ... Cygnus-X1 wake up now!

:( Anyway, in the meantime, I just keep working. It is not so bad because ... we travel a lot!

In fact, I have to leave you to finish preparing the suitcases: I'm going three months to a stay in the United States to work with Meredith and Marvin (do you remember them? They are the ones who work at HAWC and Fermi). See you when I get to USA!
