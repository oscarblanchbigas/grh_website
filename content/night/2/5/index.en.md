{{< header_night title="Signal or statistical fluctuation?">}}

Remember that hunters live surrounded by noise.

And there is no possible shortcut. The only thing we can do is face it.

Daniel taught you to make an observation OFF and subtract it. But let me tell you something: that's not going to be enough.

Sometimes **the noise takes the form of a signal**. And then we think we're seeing something, when actually what we have in front of our eyes is a ghost called statistical fluctuation.

How can we be sure if what we see is evidence that Cyg-X1 has been awakened? How can we know
that it is not a bad joke from statistics?

The only way is to have a signal that is very (but very) difficult to be produced by a statistic fluctuation from no signal. This is what we call “significance” and it is measured in units of “sigmas”.

{{< quote
    text="In physics a discovery is achieved with 5 sigmas. If what you have is 3 sigmas, then you are facing an evidence that needs more data to know if there is something or not. With less significance it is almost a matter of faith to think that there may be something." >}}

{{< img name="sigma.png" caption="When you have 5 sigmas you can ensure that statistical fluctuations could only result in a result like the one you have seen 0.00006% of the time. If you have 3 sigmas it will be 0.27% of the time.">}}

The sigmas are a measure of the confidence that the results we obtain give us. Having 5 sigmas is ensuring that there is only one possibility among 35 million that what we are seeing is nothing but noise disguised as a signal.

Sometimes I think that besides Gamma ray hunters we are hunters of Sigmas :_(

In the book I show you what is the significance and sigmas using the example of Cyg-X1 (for which we have already calculated the sigmas) and random numbers (which is what gives the noise).
