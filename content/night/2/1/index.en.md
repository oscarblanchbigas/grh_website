{{< intro
    text="This is Alba. He likes to dance salsa. And every time she travels for work take advantage of some night to go dancing. She learned as a child, watching the elders dance. Now he continues to watch movements with attention, specifically those of a black hole with a star mass that dances in the Cosmos with a nearby star. Together they form the microquasar Cygnus X-1 and Alba observes it with the MAGIC telescopes because in that dance many gamma rays are created." >}}

I use MAGIC telescopes, but in the world there are gamma ray hunters spread out using different instruments. My friend Meredith, for example, works at HAWC, an observatory that is in Mexico. I met her at a congress in Germany, where there was also Marvin, a post-doc researcher who works with the Fermi satellite.

Not all of us observe the same or the same way. Fermi and HAWC, although they are very different, see almost the whole sky as a whole. In fact, Fermi sees the whole sky thanks to the fact that he is circling the Earth. The advantages of being a satellite. Every 3.2 hours it goes around the Earth twice and looks in all directions. In MAGIC we look only at the piece of sky to which we point the telescopes. Of course, we see it in more detail than the others.

The bad thing is that when we point the telescopes at an area, we lose all the rest. But there Fermi helps us, if something important is happening, it warns us and we can quickly move the telescopes and observe what is happening.
