Now that I'm installed in the United States and I've overcome jet lag, the first thing we do is ... look at the mail. You never know what is waiting for you in the inbox, often there is nothing good. But sometimes:

{{< img name="minions-alarm.gif">}}

Actually it's just an email. And not even a person has written it. It is an automatic mail. But for me it's a big surprise. It comes from the Fermi team, they send me an alert. Do you remember? Cyg-X1 has woken up !!!

It's an alert! **Finally!**

This is exciting. Do not tell me NO. There seems to be something. The email says "MAY BE", but I'm sure we can catch the gamma rays of Cyg-X1.

Those gamma rays have been traveling for 6000 years and today we are going to get them caught. With them we can better understand how the microquasar works, how the black hole is eating the star and ejects the most energetic light in the universe. This will be the breakthrough of my thesis. The editors of the magazines will not be able to believe it, they will publish it on the cover...
