{{< header_night title="More hours">}}

With the significance we have, we can not go very far. No one is going to take us seriously if we do not get 5 Sigmas.

We need more observation hours to see if with more statistics the significance rises (good!) or disappears (arghhh!). But even that will be difficult with less than 3 sigmas.

How easy it would be to call Daniel who is operating the telescopes and tell him to keep pointing at Cyg-X1, right? But it is not he who must decide. Who manages the hours dedicated to each observation are those of the Time Allocation Committee (TAC). It's them I have to convince.

{{< quote
    text="2.7 sigmas is a good promise that something may be happening in Cyg-X1. But it would not be the first time that a promise is not fulfilled .... I'm so nervous!" >}}

The TAC gives us the go-ahead to continue observing. With the telescopes pointed, we continue working.

Look in the notebook how we analyze the data that comes to us.

What will happen to the significance? Can I change the cuts to improve it? The latter is very delicate since a biased result can easily be generated. There is a maxim in science that says: "If you know what you are looking for, find what you want?". And that is something we should avoid!
