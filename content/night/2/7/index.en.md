{{< header_night title="Cyg-X1 has played us">}}

No one said that hunting gamma rays was easy. And we are going bad if we surrender to the first one. We have to keep searching.

Stephen Hawking (sure you know him) and Kip Thorne (it will sound too) made a bet in 1975. Thorne said that Cyg-X1 was a system formed by a black hole. Hawking said no. An annual subscription to a magazine was played.

After a few years Hawking had to admit that he had lost the bet. The experimental evidence of the black hole was undeniable.

It does not matter that Cygnus-X1 has played it for me again. I learn a lot of things every day that I try to catch their gamma rays.

I know that I must analyze the data well, separate the grain from the chaff, keep calm, not get carried away by the desire. Although it is difficult, there is no other way.

You have also been able to learn it and you have taken another step in the path of the Gamma Ray Hunters.
