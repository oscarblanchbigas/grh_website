We want to thank all those people who have contributed their grain of sand to Gamma Rays Hunters with ideas, opinions, advice ... even long before it began to take shape. Especially Digna Couso, Victor López, Carol de Britos and the participants of the Bojos per la Física 2016. Surely without them it would not have been possible to get here. Thank you all!
