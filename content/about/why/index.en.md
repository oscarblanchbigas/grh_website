Gamma-Ray Hunters was born with the idea of bringing young people closer to the most energetic and extreme phenomena of the Universe and to the tools that are used to study them. To do this, we have created this platform with a format and design that seeks innovation at all times: the combination of web, python and audiovisual material.

The web application is aimed at students in Secondary schools, but everyone is welcome to enjoy the adventure that is inside. It includes educational material to know the work that is developed in the field of astronomy Gamma, information from telescopes that have been designed and built in state research centers, and a structure to obtain, manage and analyze a series of data and take conclusions about what they are observing and how it relates to what they have learned from the most extreme Universe.

The messages and the environment are adapted to the ages at which the project is directed, but it is not simply an entertainment. The complexity of the project will increase as they embark on gamma hunting, but the research component is mixed with the game, learning and the challenge of a good enigma.
