Electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium.
When a very energetic gamma photon or cosmic ray interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, they produce a cascade of particles travelling at high speed. The Cherenkov radiation of these charged particles is used to determine the origin and intensity of cosmic rays or gammas.
