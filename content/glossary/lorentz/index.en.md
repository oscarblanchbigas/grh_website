Certain physical equations have this characteristic by which they do not change shape when certain changes of coordinates are given. The Special Theory of Relativity requires that the Laws of Physics must take the same form in any inertial reference system. That is, if we have two observers whose coordinates can be related by a Lorentz transformation, any equation with covariant magnitudes will be written equal for both.
