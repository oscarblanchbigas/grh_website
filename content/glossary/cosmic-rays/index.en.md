Cosmic rays are high energy radiation composed mainly of very energetic protons and atomic nuclei.
They travel almost at the speed of light and when they hit the Earth's atmosphere they produce cascades of particles: these particles generate Cherenkov radiation and some can even reach the surface of the Earth.
But when the cosmic rays reach the Earth, it is impossible to know their origin since their trajectory has changed because they have travelled through magnetic fields that changed their initial direction.
