They are the farthest and most energetic members of a class of objects called active core galaxies. Its name comes from 'quasi-stellar', almost stars, since, when they were discovered, using optical instruments, it was very difficult to distinguish them from the stars. However, its emission spectrum was clearly unique. They have usually been formed by the collision of galaxies whose central black holes have merged to form a supermassive black hole or a binary system of black holes.
