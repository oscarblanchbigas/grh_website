It is a quantum phenomenon by which in certain occasions the particles acquire characteristic of a wave. And the other way round. What we would expect to always behave like a wave (for example light) sometimes does it as a particle. This concept was introduced by Louis-Victor de Broglie and has been experimentally demonstrated.
