Albert Einstein was the genius who decided to turn Newtonian mechanics to make it compatible with electromagnetism with his Theories of Special and General Relativity. The first is applicable to the movement of bodies in the absence of gravitational forces and in the second, Newtonian gravity is replaced with more complex formulas, although for weak fields and small velocities it coincides numerically with classical theory.
