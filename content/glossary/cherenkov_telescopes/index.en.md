They are high energy gamma photon detectors located on the Earth's surface. They have a mirror to collect the light and focus it towards the camera. They detect light produced by the Cherenkov effect from the blue to the ultraviolet of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The images taken by the camera allow us to identify if the incident particle in the atmosphere is a gamma ray and at the same time determine the direction and its energy.
The MAGIC telescopes at Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma) are an example.
