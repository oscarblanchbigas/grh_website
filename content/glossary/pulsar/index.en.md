The word 'pulsar' comes from the shortening of pulsating star and it is precisely this: a star from which we get a signal in a discontinuous way. Stated more formally, it is a neutron star that emits electromagnetic radiation while it is spinning. The emissions are due to the strong magnetic field they have and the pulse is related to the rotation period of the object and the orientation relative to the Earth. One of the best known and studied is the pulsar of the Crab Nebula, very beautiful, by the way.
