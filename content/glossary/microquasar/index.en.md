It is a binary star system that produces high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Its characteristics are similar to those of quasars, but on a smaller scale.
Microquasars produce strong and variable radio emissions often in the form of jet and have an accretion disk surrounding a compact object (black hole or neutron star) that is very bright in the range of X-rays.
