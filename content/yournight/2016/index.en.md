## What are you facing?
This is the [Crab Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula):

There is people who says that gamma-ray astrophysics can be separated into two large groups: the Crab Nebula and the rest. Perhaps they exaggerate a bit, but the truth is that this nebula seems an inexhaustible source of information. It is the most intense stable source of very high energy gamma rays that come from both the pulsar inside it and the Nebula that surrounds it. And it has also been observed that flares sometimes occur, for which the intensity can increase up to an order of magnitude.

## How to solve it?
We have data from the Crab that we have taken for several years. For each event, we have Energy, Hadroness, Square Theta, position in the chamber with respect to the position of the Crab, the time in which the gamma ray arrived (the day according to the Convention of Julian Reduced, second and more) and to which phase of the pulsar of the Crab corresponds this time. With this data you can:

- See if the Crab Nebula emits gamma rays
- Search if there is any other source in the field of vision
- Study if the amount of gamma rays that reach us from the Crab Nebula changes over time
- See if the pulsar also emits gamma rays

If you have already gone through the other 4 nights, our hunters will have explained how to do it. Now is the time when you are also a Gamma Ray Hunter. If you have any questions or do not remember how to do something, you can always revisit Daniel, Alba, Quim and Leyre on their nights or ask them on the comments page on the right.

And, of course, if you want to do more with the data, the notebook on the right is all yours to try whatever you want. But do not forget to explain what you do in some way (a presentation, a code, a video while using the web application, ...) and send it to us if you want to participate in the draw to spend a real night in the MAGIC telescopes !

## YOUR TURN!
