## What are you facing?

This is the binary system PSR J2032 + 4127 / MT91 21 formed by a pulsar and a star Be:

The pulsar was discovered in 2009 with Fermi, but already in 2002 HESS observed gamma-ray emission from that position. At that time there was no known emission from that point on any other wavelength and the source was called: TeV J2032 + 4130. It was not until 2015 that it was discovered that the pulsar was part of a binary system that has a period of 50 years and it happens that in November of 2017 the periastro was produced, the moment of those 50 years in which the two objects of the binary system are closer.

## How to solve it?

We have data from TeV J2032 + 4130 that we have taken for several years. For each event, we have Energy, Hadroness, Square Theta, position in the camera with respect to the position of the pulsar, the time in which the gamma ray arrived (the day according to the Convention of Julian Reduced, second and more) and to which phase of the pulsar of the Crab corresponds this time. With this data you can:

- See if TeV J2032 + 4130 emits gamma rays
- Search if there is any other source in the field of vision
- Study if the amount of gamma rays that reach us from TeV 2032 changes over time
- See if there is something different in November 2017
- See if the pulsar also emits gamma rays

If you have already gone through the other 4 nights, our hunters will have explained how to do it. Now is the time when you are also a Gamma Ray Hunter. If you have any questions or do not remember how to do something, you can always revisit Daniel, Alba, Quim and Leyre on their nights or ask them on the comments page on the right.

And, of course, if you want to do more with the data, the notebook on the right is all yours to try whatever you want. But do not forget to explain what you do in some way (a presentation, a code, a video while using the web application, ...) and send it to us if you want to participate in the draw to spend a real night in the MAGIC telescopes !

## YOUR TURN!
